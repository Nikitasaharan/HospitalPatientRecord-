# Hospital Patient Record Management System

## Overview
The **Hospital Patient Record Management System** is a Python-based solution that demonstrates the practical use of **Linked Lists**, **Stacks**, and **Queues** to manage hospital operations efficiently. The system allows users to add, delete, and retrieve patient records, handle emergency cases using priority queues, and compute billing and inventory using polynomial and postfix operations.

## Objectives
- Implement linked lists to store patient records.
- Use a stack to perform undo operations.
- Manage emergency queues using circular and priority queues.
- Perform polynomial-based billing calculations.
- Evaluate postfix expressions for inventory calculations.

## Data Structures Used
- **Linked List** → For dynamic patient record management.  
- **Stack** → To handle undo operations for recent changes.  
- **Queue (Circular/Priority)** → To manage emergency patients efficiently.  
- **Polynomial Operations** → To compute billing.  
- **Postfix Evaluation** → For inventory calculations.

## Functionalities
1. Add a new patient record  
2. Delete a patient record  
3. Undo last admission  
4. Manage emergency queue  
5. Calculate billing  
6. Evaluate inventory using postfix expressions  

## Implementation Steps
1. Define the `Patient` ADT and implement linked list insertion/deletion.
2. Implement stack-based undo mechanism.
3. Develop queue operations for emergency handling.
4. Perform polynomial operations for billing.
5. Evaluate postfix expressions for inventory management.

## Technologies
- Python 3  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Data Structures (Linked List, Stack, Queue)

## Learning Outcomes
- Application of linear data structures in real-world systems.
- Implementation of undo and priority-based mechanisms.
- Understanding of computational tasks using polynomial and postfix logic.
